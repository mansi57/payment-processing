## 🔧 **ISSUES RESOLVED DURING DEVELOPMENT**

### **1. ✅ AuthorizeNet SDK Constants** 
- **Issue:** `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'authCaptureTransaction')`
- **Resolution:** Replaced undefined SDK constants with string literals
- **Impact:** Fixed all SDK-related errors

### **2. ✅ Validation Schema Corrections**
- **Issue:** Validation expecting `transactionId` in body for URL parameters
- **Resolution:** Updated schemas for capture, refund, void endpoints
- **Impact:** All endpoints now validate correctly

### **3. ✅ TypeScript Compilation Errors**
- **Issue:** Various TS errors for unused parameters and type mismatches
- **Resolution:** Added proper type annotations and renamed unused parameters
- **Impact:** Clean compilation with zero errors

### **4. 🔄 AuthorizeNet API Format (Deferred)**
- **Issue:** `JSON root object has multiple properties` API error
- **Current State:** Bypassed with mock service implementation
- **Production Path:** Requires SDK request structure investigation
