## 🧪 **Testing Workflows**

### **🏥 1. HEALTH CHECKS**

Start with health checks to verify all services are operational:

1. **System Health Check** - Overall system status
2. **Payment Service Health** - Payment processing status
3. **Subscription Service Health** - Subscription management status
4. **Webhook Service Health** - Webhook delivery status

**Expected Result:** All services should return "operational" status.

### **💳 2. BASIC PAYMENT PROCESSING**

Test core payment functionality:

#### **A. Purchase Payment Flow**
1. **Purchase Payment** - Complete payment (auth + capture)
   - Amount: $49.99
   - Test card: 4111111111111111
   - **Auto-saves:** `transaction_id` for subsequent tests

#### **B. Authorization/Capture Flow**
1. **Authorize Payment** - Hold funds
   - Amount: $75.00
   - **Auto-saves:** `transaction_id`
2. **Capture Payment** - Capture authorized funds
   - Uses saved `transaction_id`
   - Amount: $75.00 (or partial)

#### **C. Refund/Void Operations**
1. **Refund Payment** - Refund captured payment
   - Partial refund: $25.00
   - Include reason for refund
2. **Void Payment** - Cancel authorized payment

### **🔒 3. IDEMPOTENCY TESTING**

Verify safe retry mechanisms:

#### **A. Generate Idempotency Key**
1. **Generate Idempotency Key** - Creates UUID for testing
   - **Auto-generates:** `idempotency_key` variable

#### **B. Idempotency Flow**
1. **First Idempotent Request** - Initial payment with idempotency key
   - Amount: $99.99
   - **Auto-saves:** `transaction_id`
2. **Duplicate Idempotent Request** - Same request with same key
   - **Expected:** Returns cached response with same `transaction_id`

**Key Testing Points:**
- ✅ First request creates new transaction
- ✅ Duplicate request returns same transaction ID
- ✅ Response time is faster for duplicate requests

---

### **📋 4. SUBSCRIPTION PLANS**

Test subscription plan management:

#### **A. Plan Creation**
1. **Create Basic Plan** - $9.99/month with 14-day trial
   - **Auto-saves:** `plan_id`
2. **Create Premium Plan** - $49.99/month with setup fee

#### **B. Plan Management**
1. **List All Plans** - View available plans
2. **Get Specific Plan** - Retrieve plan details

**Expected Results:**
- Plans created with correct pricing and intervals
- Trial periods and setup fees properly configured
- Metadata stored correctly

---

### **🔄 5. SUBSCRIPTION MANAGEMENT**

Test complete subscription lifecycle:

#### **A. Subscription Creation**
1. **Create Subscription** - Subscribe customer to plan
   - Uses saved `plan_id`
   - 7-day trial period
   - **Auto-saves:** `subscription_id`

#### **B. Subscription Operations**
1. **Get Subscription** - Retrieve subscription details
2. **Update Subscription** - Change quantity to 3
3. **Cancel Subscription (At Period End)** - Graceful cancellation
4. **Resume Subscription** - Reactivate cancelled subscription
5. **Cancel Subscription (Immediate)** - Immediate cancellation

**Key Testing Points:**
- ✅ Subscription status progression: trialing → active → canceled
- ✅ Quantity updates affect billing
- ✅ Trial periods work correctly
- ✅ Cancellation options work as expected

---

### **📡 6. WEBHOOK MANAGEMENT**

Test webhook infrastructure:

#### **A. Webhook Endpoint Setup**
1. **Create Webhook Endpoint** - Register webhook URL
   - URL: Use webhook.site for testing
   - Events: payment.succeeded, subscription.created, etc.
   - **Auto-saves:** `webhook_endpoint_id`

#### **B. Webhook Operations**
1. **List Webhook Endpoints** - View all endpoints
2. **Get Webhook Endpoint** - Retrieve endpoint details
3. **Update Webhook Endpoint** - Modify events or description
4. **Test Webhook Endpoint** - Send test event
5. **Get Webhook Endpoint Health** - Check delivery stats
6. **Delete Webhook Endpoint** - Remove endpoint

**Key Testing Points:**
- ✅ Webhooks are created with proper event subscriptions
- ✅ Test events are delivered successfully
- ✅ Health monitoring shows delivery statistics
- ✅ Updates modify endpoint configuration

---

### **🔐 7. WEBHOOK SECURITY**

Test webhook signature validation:

#### **A. Signature Generation**

   - Amount: $149.99
   - **Triggers:** payment.succeeded webhook

#### **B. Complete Subscription Flow**
1. **Complete Subscription Flow** - Full subscription lifecycle
   - Creates subscription
   - **Triggers:** subscription.created webhook
   - **Triggers:** subscription.trial_will_end (if trial expires)

---

## 📈 **Advanced Testing Scenarios**

### **🔄 Recurring Billing Testing**

The system processes recurring payments every 5 minutes. To test:

1. Create subscription with short trial (1-2 days)
2. Wait for trial to expire
3. Monitor webhook events for:
   - `subscription.trial_will_end`
   - `subscription.payment_succeeded`
   - `invoice.payment_succeeded`

### **⚡ Webhook Delivery Testing**

1. **Set up webhook.site URL**
   - Visit https://webhook.site
   - Copy your unique URL
   - Update webhook endpoint with this URL

2. **Monitor deliveries:**
   - Perform payment/subscription actions
   - Check webhook.site for delivered events
   - Verify signature headers

### **🛡️ Error Handling Testing**

Test various error scenarios:

1. **Invalid payment data:** Missing required fields
2. **Invalid idempotency:** Reuse key with different request
3. **Invalid webhook URL:** Use non-existent domain
4. **Invalid plan/subscription IDs:** Use non-existent IDs

---

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues:**

1. **Server Not Responding:**
   ```bash
   # Check if server is running
   curl http://localhost:3000/health
   
   # Restart server
   npm start
   ```

2. **Webhook Deliveries Failing:**
   - Check webhook URL is accessible
   - Verify webhook.site URL is current
   - Check endpoint status in collection

3. **Variables Not Saving:**
   - Ensure you're using the correct environment
   - Check test scripts in requests
   - Verify collection variables are set

### **Test Data Reset:**

To reset test data, restart the server:
```bash
# This clears in-memory storage
npm start
```
